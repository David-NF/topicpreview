Hi! I'm VSE from the phpBB community.

Welcome to my Github repository for my MODs for phpBB3.

*
* Topic Preview 
* 
* Current Release version: 1.0.10
* Development version: 1.1.0
* 
* ========================================================================
*
* Description:
* Displays an excerpt from the first post of a topic when the user hovers 
* their mouse over the topic title, using the browser's built-in tooltip 
* ability. The amount of text shown can be defined in the ACP, and the mod 
* can also be turned off. It's much more simplified than other similar mods 
* (no javascript or css needed). This version is designed to mimic the 
* vbulletin method.
