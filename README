Hi! I'm VSE from the phpBB community.

Welcome to my Github repository for my MODs for phpBB3.

*
* Topic Preview 
* 
* Current Release version: v1.0.7
* Current Develop version: v1.0.8
* ========================================================================

* Description:
* Displays an excerpt from the first post of a topic when the user hovers 
* their mouse over the topic title, using the browser's built-in tooltip 
* ability. The amount of text shown can be defined in the ACP, and the mod 
* can also be turned off. It's much more simplified than other similar mods 
* (no javascript or css needed), this version is designed to mimic the 
* vbulletin method.

* To-do list:
